- make the secret field the first entry of the polynomial
- add lagrange logic to build the public polynomial knowing all the shares (do it myself?)
- add id to nodes
- link shares to corresponding nodes
-

- move the main() to a coordinator class, handling the logic
- add the commitment logic (with crypto) before sending the shares, verify shares match the commitment
- move the coordinator to not have one, instead have all nodes arrange themselves and know what they should do
